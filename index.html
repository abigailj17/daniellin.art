        <p>Daniel Lin (he/him) is a cellist, pianist, improviser, and composer. Currently based in the Upper Valley, he regularly music-directs and plays music for the Dartmouth College Theater Department, Northern Stage, and the New London Barn Playhouse, among other local productions.
            Outside of theater, Daniel is active in jazz and Black Creative Music communities, recently performing with Tomeka Reid, Anna Morris, Anna Weber, Taylor Ho Bynum, Bill Cole, Lisette Santiago, and Ras Moshe, among other ensembles such as the CherryAhCole Combo and the Coast Jazz Orchestra.
            His practice emphasizes collective improvisation and deep listening, drawing inspiration from the musicâ€™s legacies of liberation, social justice, and radical organization/solidarities.
            Most of the year, Daniel works at the Dartmouth Libraries as a Digital Library Fellow, with interests in digital cultural heritage, time-based media preservation/access, and organizational workflows.
