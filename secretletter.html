        <p>Daniel, you are simply the best. I love being silly with you - going to Sunday brunch or seeking midnight stars and walking backwards in the shadows of streetlights. 
        And I am grateful that I can be serious with you as we both try and figure out how we fit into this world or break out of its boxes. I am so lucky to have been your roommate this past year
        and am so lucky to have a friendship that just works so well. Thank you for sharing so much of yourself with me. I'm excited to see where this year takes you and hope we can still
        do some cooking and singing together at some point soon. Even though we have a few more doors between us now, please call if you ever need anything :)
        
        <p>Love, Abigail</p>
